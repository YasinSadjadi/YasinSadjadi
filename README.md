## 🚀 Projects I'm proud of

- 🛒 **eShop GraphQL Backend**  
  A backend for an online shop built with **ASP.NET Core** and **HotChocolate v14**.  
  Features include:  
  - GraphQL Queries & Mutations with filtering, sorting, paging  
  - EF Core with SQL Server for data persistence  
  - Repository pattern for clean data access  
  - Docker Compose setup for database (SQL Server)  
  - Ready-to-scale layered architecture (API / Application / Infrastructure)
 
- 🛠️ **BlazorLayout Template**

  A clean and modular **Blazor WebAssembly** layout template designed for fast project setup and scalable architecture.
  Features include:  
  - Standalone **Blazor WebAssembly** project template  
  - Fully structured layout and page organization  
  - Clean separation between UI and logic layers  
  - Component-based, easily customizable design  
  - Ready to use from **Visual Studio → New Project** or via CLI  
  - Ideal as a solid starting point for Blazor applications and prototypes


- 👁️ **Face Recognition System**  
  Real-time face recognition using `ArcFace ResNet100` and `ONNX Runtime GPU`. Run `machine.py` for CLI-based state-machine execution or `main.py` for a PyQt5 interface. CUDA support recommended.

- 🤖 **Line Follower Robot**  
  A simple but reliable Raspberry Pi-based robot that follows lines using a state machine approach. Code structured for clarity and real-world testing.

- 🗣️ **Voice Assistant**  
  Built with [`microsoft/phi-2`](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-2) (2.7B params), OpenAI's Whisper for English speech-to-text, and VITS for English TTS. Lightweight, offline-ready.
